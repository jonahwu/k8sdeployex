two mentod of NodePort and Loadbalancer are the same.
All deal with same node loadbalancer, and cannot across node.
for exmaple nodeport is 30001 and loadbalancer is 30002(watch out it dosen't contain 30001 information).

curl http://node1:30001  (if node1 have 2 pods there, it will round robin by using nodeport that is route by proxy)
curl http://node2:30001 (the other node)

curl http://node1:30002 (if we set up by loadbalncer method)
curl http://node2:30002


Two method are similar, but is not great solution.
It still need more high level, such as nginx to route node1 and node2. 
with port 30001 if use nodeport method.
with port 30002 if use loadbalancer method.


in loadbalancer method 
"port": 8033,
"targetPort": 80,
"nodePort": 30002
port is the clusterip's port 
targetport is the frontend's web pod port
nodePort is proxy aware.
and you will not see in system.
